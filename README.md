Welcome to CMPSC 390 Spring 2017
==============================

In this class you will use a variety of tools that are used in the real world that will help you develop a web application.  The purpose of this class is to help minimize the gap from what you learn in school to things that you will be doing everyday in a full time job.   You will learn proper coding techniques as well as common programming patterns.

You will understand the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and how it is executed using the Agile model.  The tool that we will use to help in understanding the Agile model is JIRA.
